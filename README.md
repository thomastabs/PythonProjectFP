My first and second Python Projects in colllege during Programming Fundamentals

- About my first Python Project: Yeah its kinda sad to see but it was my first experience with programming in general
                                 but I liked it a lot!
- About my second Python Project: I found this second project more hard than the last one so I couldn't finish the last 2 functions in time,
                                  but overall it was a fun learning experience.
